						educational environment. Hosted by Sam Holmes and a team of passionate organizers, our
						monthly meetups offer an opportunity to network, learn, and showcase your projects. At
						each event, you'll enjoy complimentary food and drinks during our networking lunch,
						followed by a series of engaging presentations on various developer and engineering
						topics. After the talks, we break into groups for casual networking, project showcases,
						and coding help. Whether you're a seasoned developer or just starting out, there's
						something for everyone. Be sure to bring your laptop if you'd like to share your latest
						project or give a presentation. We look forward to meeting you and seeing what you're
						excited about!`}
